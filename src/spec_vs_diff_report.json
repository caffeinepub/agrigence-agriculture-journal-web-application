  "summary": "The diff adds a migration that seeds an Editor-in-Chief editorial member and updates frontend role display logic to show the canonical \"Editor-in-Chief\" label when `isEditorInChief` is true. However, the backend seeding only occurs when the existing editorialMembers map is empty, and the migration introduces unrequested personal data (email/phone).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Editor-in-Chief record is added/persisted such that it is present regardless of existing editorial members (so it will be returned by `getAllEditorialMembers` and appear in the Editorial Board page and Admin Panel list).",
      "reason": "The migration only inserts the new member when `old.editorialMembers.isEmpty()`. If the canister already has editorial members, the new record will not be added, so the entry may not appear in listing APIs/UI for existing deployments.",

  "summary": "The diff does not clearly implement a rollback to v59. Most notably, the frontend router setup appears to omit the required /consultation route, jeopardizing the acceptance criteria that primary routes (including /consultation) load without runtime errors. The changes also include several substantial backend/frontend feature additions (e.g., Stripe integration, blob storage mixins, user profiles, product management) that are not explicitly requested by the rollback-only BuildRequest.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "All primary routes load without runtime errors in the browser console (at minimum: /, /consultation, /products, /subscription, /admin).",
      "reason": "The router configuration summary explicitly states the consultation route is not defined, so /consultation is unlikely to load as required.",

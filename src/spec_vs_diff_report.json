However, at least one acceptance detail (curly quotes) is not met based on the shown content, and the full ordered list items 13–20 cannot be verified due to truncation.",

      "requirement": "Render the introductory paragraphs and the 3 bullet points exactly as provided, preserving punctuation and curly quotes (e.g., “Popular Articles”).",
      "reason": "The page content shown uses straight quotes around \"Popular Articles\" and \"Technical Articles\" rather than curly quotes, which violates the requirement to preserve curly quotes verbatim.",

      "reason": "The diff output is truncated mid-way through the Formatting Guidelines list (after item 17/18 begins), so items 13–20 being present and exact cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",
